This project moved to <a href="http://gitlab.com/m10cube/m10">GitLAB</a><p>
And <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/171770-m10cube">HACKADAY</a>

M10CUBE is a Practical Form Factor Ecosystem. It is the idea of a micro controller cube 10x10x10 cm.
SCOPE:
A control block to be used like a Lego "brick" to solve any control problems. Definitely a job for micro controllers.A smart design to be used as PLC or IOT device for Industry 4.0 and M2M deployments.
FIELD OF APPLICATIONS:
PLC, IOT, Education, Home Automation, Light Industrial Applications
PCBs, Schematics (Eagle and KiCAD), 3D enclosures and software are in constant developing.
Applications will keep coming so to encourage everyone to get involved and to use the M10CUBE out of the box
