M10-CUBE ecosystem is a community project and is the idea of a micro controller cube 10x10x10 cm. It is a hardware agnostic cube.
In practice only one rule must fulfilled for us to say that this is an M10 device:

External enclosure (CUBE) maximum dimensions X = 10cm, Y = 10cm, Z = Up to 10cm .  Electronics inside must be powered by 24 DC or 220 AC from main supply.

Some sub rules must also apply but it is to verify that every M10-CUBE incarnation can communicate and stand side by side with the other.
Directives:

Used materials and modules out of the self if possible.
DIY friendly.
Think Green and Reuse philosophy
