M10-CUBE ecosystem is a community project and is the idea of a micro controller cube 10x10x10 cm. It is a hardware agnostic cube.

In practice only one rule must fulfilled for us to say that this is an M10 device.

- Used materials out of the self. 
- DIY friendly. 
- Think Green and Reuse philosophy
